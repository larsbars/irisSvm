irisSvm
=======

Java implementation of SVM to process the iris dataset.

This code can be run without any compilation of any sort.  Take a look in the irisSvmApp/bin folder.  You can run irisSvm(non-windows) or irisSvm.bat(windows) directly.  
There are two parameters required, the first is the path to the iris.data dataset.  This dataset has been included in the project for convenience under the data directory.
The second parameter is the path to the folder where you would like the result file to print out.
